Fun board game against the computer! Whoever will win?

This project is made with the intention of learning functional programming and the Clojure programming language in particular. It presents the user with a board game called "Alquerque" where they would be able to choose which move to make, and the board then updates in real time. Games are to be played against the computer which draws its moves after each succssive turn of the player. The game is won (or lost, depending on your situation) when there are only one type of piece remaining on the board (the user draws black tiles whereas the computer plays red)
